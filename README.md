# Jenkins 2.x Continuous Integration Cookbook - Third Edition
This is the code repository for [Jenkins 2.x Continuous Integration Cookbook - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/jenkins-2x-continuous-integration-cookbook-third-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788297943), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Jenkins 2.x is one of the most popular Continuous Integration servers in the market today. It was designed to maintain, secure, communicate, test, build, and improve the software development process.

This book will begin by guiding you through steps for installing and configuring Jenkins 2.x on AWS and Azure. This is followed by steps that enable you to manage and monitor Jenkins 2.x. You will also explore the ways to enhance the overall security of Jenkins 2.x. You will then explore the steps involved in improving the code quality using SonarQube. Then, you will learn the ways to improve quality, followed by how to run performance and functional tests against a web application and web services.

Finally, you will see what the available plugins are, concluding with best practices to improve quality.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
@charset "utf-8";
#test {
background-image: url(/userContent/camera.png);
}
#main-table{
background-image: url(/userContent/camera.png)
!important;
```

This book is for beginners. It assumes that you are familiar with at least the Java
programming language. Knowledge of core Java and JEE is essential in order to use this
book to gain better insight. A strong understanding of program logic will provide you with
the background to be productive with Jenkins while using plugins to write commands for
the shell.
As the application development life cycle covers lot of tools in general, it is essential to have
some knowledge of repositories such as SVN and Git, IDE tools such as Eclipse, and build
tools such as Ant and Maven.
Knowledge of code analysis tools will make the job easier in terms of configuration and
integration; however, it is not vital to perform the exercises given in this book. Most of the
configuration steps are clearly mentioned. SonarQuve 6.3 version is used for code analysis.
You will be walked through the steps required to install Jenkins on a Windows and Linuxbased host. In order to be immediately successful, you will need administrative access to a
host that runs a modern version of Windows and Linux; Windows 10 is what will be used
for demonstration purposes. If you are a more experienced reader, then a recent release of
almost any distribution will work just as well (but you may be required to do a little bit of
extra work that is not outlined in the book).
You can use a free trial of Microsoft Azure to work on some recipes.
Additionally, you will need access to the internet to download plugins that you do not
already have, as well as an installation of Jenkins. Any normal hardware configuration is
good enough, such as 4 GB RAM and 500 GB hard disk.
